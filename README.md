Does it ever happen to you that you don't know what movie to watch and you start looking at titles without knowing how to make a decision? Well, for that reason I have created my latest web app. It is a website to be able to search for movies searching by title, and to be able to review the most voted, in theaters and upcoming releases. Users can leave their vote too.

The data comes from the TMDB API.

Developed with HTML, styled with Sass, I use Javascript, BEM and React methodology. Deploy to Firebase. Fully responsive.
